Block request and block reply messages should follow the direct message routing mechanism
-> modify the DM receiving mecahnism to accept block request, then call file_check

search request should follow the peer based broadcasting
-> new type of rumor message

search reply should be a DM
-> how to make sure we know who to send to? Guarantee origin in is the routing table

where should the file dialogue be? It should be under the main dialogue, and after selecting file, emit signal to a new class that takes care of files
-> this will call the slot that add new entry by file name

the file class should support these methods:
internal structure storing file data
check whether we have the file
build entry by file name
	requires interaction with OS to get data
retrieve meta file by ID
retrieve block by ID and block num
